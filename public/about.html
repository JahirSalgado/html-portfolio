<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Well, if I wanted to describe myself into a simple word, it would be "belieber".</p>

<p>First of all, I do trust that, most of the cases, you must believe in something in order to simply see it.</p>

<p>I like to think that some things are already done even before I sart doing them. Finally, I just want to say that this idea isn't mine, I heard of it in a seminary and, then, from the most important person of human history, the Lord Jesus Christ, the one I also believe in.</p>
